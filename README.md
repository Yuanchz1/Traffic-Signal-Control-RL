Traffic Signal Control with Reinforcement Learning | Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA   

Course Project | Jan. 2024 – May. 2024                

•	Developed a novel reinforcement learning-based traffic signal control (TSC) strategy that optimizes traffic flow by incorporating real-time traffic pressure and queue length data.

•	Implemented the hybrid Adv-MP-Co-Light reward function, combining features of Adv-CoLight and Adv-MPLight, to enhance the efficiency of urban traffic management.

•	Analyzed and demonstrated significant improvements in traffic efficiency and congestion mitigation using real-world datasets (e.g., Hangzhou Dataset).
